# NavbarWidget

The `NavbarWidget` is a custom Flutter widget designed to create a flexible navigation bar with toggleable search functionality and positioned content. It allows for easy implementation of a customizable navigation bar in a Flutter application.

## Overview

The `NavbarWidget` consists of three main sections:

1. **Main Content:** Positioned below the navigation bar, the main content of the screen is displayed. In the provided code, a placeholder container is used to represent the main content area. Users can replace this with their desired content.

2. **Navigation Bar:** Positioned at the top of the screen, the navigation bar is created using an `AppBar` widget enclosed within a `Container`. It includes:
   - Toggleable search bar functionality with an icon button to show/hide the search bar.
   - Customizable navigation buttons/actions represented by `IconButton` and `TextButton` widgets.

3. **Heading:** Positioned below the navigation bar, it displays a bold title and a description. In the provided code, a static heading is shown as an example. Users can customize this area to display their own headings or text.

## Usage

To use the `NavbarWidget` in your Flutter application:

1. Import the `NavbarWidget` class into your Dart file.
   ```dart
   import 'package:path_to_your_navbar_widget/navbar_widget.dart';
   ```

2. Implement the `NavbarWidget` within your widget tree.
   ```dart
   NavbarWidget()
   ```

3. Customize the `NavbarWidget` to fit your application's requirements. Modify the navigation bar items, main content, or heading as needed.

## Example

Below is an example demonstrating how to integrate `NavbarWidget` into a simple Flutter application:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:path_to_your_navbar_widget/navbar_widget.dart'; // Replace with the correct import path

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: NavbarWidget(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

Replace `'package:path_to_your_navbar_widget/navbar_widget.dart'` with the actual import path of your `NavbarWidget` file.
